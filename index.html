                                and also your gender. It then calculates the day of the week you were 
                                born i.e. whether you were born on Monday, Tuesday etc. It then gives an Akan
                                name(derived from Ghanian culture whereby children in Ghana are at times given their first name 
                                as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born and their gender)</p>
